# Ownership, References, Snapshots

Amongst the numerous features Cairo1.0 inherits from Rust, we have the 
concept of Ownership. All computer programs have to effectively manage the way they use a computer's memory while running.

In most languages, there's an in-built garbage collector, that automatically looks for no-longer used memory as the program runs, while few other languages, expects the programmer to explicitly allocate and free memory, Cairo similar to Rust uses a way different approach: managing memory using a set of Ownership rules that the compiler checks for.

If you've never programmed in Rust previously, the concept of Ownership might take some time to get used to. In this section, we are going to try to break down this concept in simpler terms!
