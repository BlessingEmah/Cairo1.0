# Felt and Other Primitive Types

Data types are indeed an essential part of programming languages, including Cairo. They are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold, which is important for ensuring the correct manipulation and storage of that data.


In Cairo 1.0, there are several new data types in addition to the felt data type. These include:

- `Felt`: is a 252-bit integer within the range `0 â‰¤ x < P`, where `P` is a prime number. It is used for efficient computation and allows for many arithmetic operations to be implemented using modular arithmetic techniques.

- `Boolean`: This data type can hold one of two values, true or false, and is often used for conditional statements and logical operations.

- `String`: This data type is used for storing sequences of characters, such as text.

- `Struct`: This data type is used to create complex types.

- `Integers`: There are several different sizes available, including `u8` (an 8-bit unsigned integer), `u16` (a 16-bit unsigned integer), `u32` (a 32-bit unsigned integer), `u64` (a 64-bit unsigned integer), and `u256` (a 256-bit unsigned integer).

- `Mappings`: Mappings are used to store and retrieve data in contract storage.


In addition to these data types, Cairo also supports arrays, which allow multiple values of the same data type to be stored in a single variable, as well as tuples, which allow multiple values of different data types to be grouped together.
