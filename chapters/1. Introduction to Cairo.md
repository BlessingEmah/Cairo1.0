# Introduction to Cairo

Cairo is a programming language that enables the creation of provable programs, which can be used to demonstrate to one party that a specific computation was performed accurately. This feature makes Cairo and similar proof systems ideal for providing scalability to blockchain networks.

StarkNet, a Layer 2 scalability solution for Ethereum, uses Cairo as the programming language for its infrastructure and for creating StarkNet contracts. If you are seeking StarkNet-specific documentation, you can refer to the resource [here](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/)
