# Data Types: Arrays, Structs, Constants, Tuples, and Mappings

In this section, we would be going through the above data types and how they are defined in Cairo 1.0

## Arrays

An Array is a data structure that stores a collection of a single data type.

In Cairo 1.0, they are defined as follows:

```
use array::ArrayTrait;

let mut feltArray = ArrayTrait::new();

feltArray.append(1)
feltArray.append(2)

let mut u32Array = ArrayTrait::new();

u32Array.append(1_u32);
u32Array.append(2_u32);
```

- First of all, we have import `ArrayTrait` using `use array::ArrayTrait`. `ArrayTrait` is a `trait`(you will learning about this later in this guide) that makes the creation and use of arrays possible in Cairo 1.0
- Then, `let mut feltArray = ArrayTrait::new();` allows us to create the array using the `new()` method inside of the `ArrayTrait`. Also, note that the `mut` makes it mutable. Without the `mut` keyword, we won't be able to append values to the array.
- I also created another array `u32Array` to store `u32` values because an array can only take one data types. Here, the data type to be stored in the array is inferred using the first value appended to the array.
- Apart from `new()` and `append()`, there are other methods available in the ArrayTrait
