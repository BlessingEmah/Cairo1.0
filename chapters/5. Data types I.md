# Data Types: Arrays, Structs, Constants, Tuples, and Mappings

In this section, we would be going through the above data types and how they are defined in Cairo 1.0

## Arrays

An Array is a data structure that stores a collection of a single data type.

In Cairo 1.0, they are defined as follows:

```
use array::ArrayTrait;

let mut feltArray = ArrayTrait::new();

feltArray.append(1)
feltArray.append(2)

let mut u32Array = ArrayTrait::new();

u32Array.append(1_u32);
u32Array.append(2_u32);
```

- First of all, we have import `ArrayTrait` using `use array::ArrayTrait`. `ArrayTrait` is a `trait`(you will learning about this later in this guide) that makes the creation and use of arrays possible in Cairo 1.0
- Then, `let mut feltArray = ArrayTrait::new();` allows us to create the array using the `new()` method inside of the `ArrayTrait`. Also, note that the `mut` makes it mutable. Without the `mut` keyword, we won't be able to append values to the array.
- I also created another array `u32Array` to store `u32` values because an array can only take one data types. Here, the data type to be stored in the array is inferred using the first value appended to the array.
- Apart from `new()` and `append()`, there are other methods available in the ArrayTrait

## Structs

A Struct is data structure that serves as a blueprint for the creation of a custom group of related values.

In Cairo 1.0, they are defined as follows:

```cairo
// Definition
struct Person {
    name: felt252,
    age: u32,
}

//Usage
let person1 = Person{name: 'Godspower', age: 21};

//Accessing the values
person1.name;
person1.age;
```

- Just like in Rust, structs could also contain logic but we won't treat that now.

## Constants

Constants are constants..ðŸ‘€. They are constant and immutable values actually. Here are a few rules about how they are defined in Cairo 1.0.

- Constants should be `defined and assigned` in the global scope. That is, they shouldn't be created inside of functions.
- Types are not inferred for constants. That is, you must set the type as at the time of creation
- Constants can't be changed so using the `mut` keyword is not allowed when creating a constant.

This is how a constants are created:

```
const name: felt252 = 'Godspower Eze';
```

## Tuples

Tuples are similar to arrays but they can store different data types.

They are defined as follows:

```
#[derive(Drop)]
struct Person {
    name: felt252,
    age: u32
}

let person1 = Person{name: 'Godspower Eze', age: 21_u32};

// Creation
let testTuple = (2_u32, 45, person1);

// Unpacking
let (first, second, third) = testTuple;

```

- don't worry about what `#[derive(Drop)]` does for now.

## Mappings

 Mappings is a key-value data structure; assigning a `value` to a `key` in persistent storage. They are used in Starknet contracts.

 They are defined as follows:

```
#[contract]
mod Bank{
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use starknet::get_caller_address;

    struct Storage{
        balances: LegacyMap::<ContractAddress, u_32>,
    }

    #[external]
    fn increase_balance(value: u32){
        let caller = get_caller_address();
        balances::write(caller, value);
    }
}
```

- As previously mentioned, the `Storage` struct in a Starknet contract houses all storage values.
- Here, we have a mapping called `balances`. It maps a contract address(`key`) to a balance(`value`)
- In the `increase_balance` function, we update the mapping using `balances::write(caller, value);` which uses the caller address(`caller`) as key and `value` as the value
