## Defining events

Yes! Thats right. Events are now supported in Cairo.

In Cairo contracts, an `events` is a mechanism for notifying the outside world about a specific occurrence within the contract. Events provide a way for a contract to emit information about its internal state changes, which can be used by external applications to react to these changes.

To define an event in Cairo, you use the #[event] attribute followed by a function with the name of the event and a set of arguments(with its type) in parentheses.

Here's an example of how you can define an event in Cairo:

#[event]

```
fn BalanceIncrease(balance: felt252) {}
```

In this instance, the event is `BalanceIncrease` and the value(s) We want to emit is written within the bracket as arguments; we emmitted the `balance` here.
