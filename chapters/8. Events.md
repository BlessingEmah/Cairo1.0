# Events

In Cairo contracts, an `event` is a mechanism for notifying the outside world about a specific occurrence within the contract. Events provide a way for a contract to emit information about its internal state changes, which can be used by external applications outside of Starknet.

## Defining Events

To define an event in Cairo, we use the macro `#[event]` followed by a function with the name of the event and a set of arguments(with its type) in parentheses.

Here's an example of how you can define an event in Cairo:

```cairo
    #[event]
    fn BalanceIncreased(address: ContractAddress, balance: felt252) {}
```

In this instance, the event is `BalanceIncreased` and the value(s) emitted (`address`, `balance`) is written within the parantheses as arguments.

## Emitting Events
After defining events, we'll need to emit them in the desired function.
Emitting events in Cairo 1.0 is a bit different from how it's done in Cairo 0.x:

```cairo
    BalanceIncreased(user_address, user_balance);
```
